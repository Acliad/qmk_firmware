## Info
This keymap is designed to be used with Cadence Allegro PCB. By default it's setup to use the left two columns as layer selection keys for layers 1-12. A single tap toggles the layer, a double tap isolates the layer. The main numpad section can be toggled between numpad mode and CAD mode by single tapping the numlock key*. In CAD mode, the numpad acts as macros for activating commonly used tools. While the keymap is designed for use with Cadence's software, it can be easily adapted for other CAD programs. 

\* A doubletap will toggle numlock
